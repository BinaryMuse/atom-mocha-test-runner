# Atom Mocha Test Runner

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

By default, Atom runs your tests with Jasmine. Atom allows you to specify a custom test runner using the `atomTestRunner` field in your `package.json`, but implementing a custom test runner is not straightforward. This module allows you to run your specs using Mocha with minimal fuss.

## Installation

```
$ apm install [--save-dev] atom-mocha-test-runner
```

## Usage

### Default Test Runner

If you want to use all the default options, simply pass the module name as the `atomTestRunner` value:

```json
  "atomTestRunner": "atom-mocha-test-runner"
```

Note that your `package.json` may be cached by Atom's compile cache, so if adding or changing that field doesn't seem to work, try quitting and restarting Atom.

### Programmatic Usage
